Nowadays, more and more activities are becoming more and more popular in high school. Our school also attaches great importance to after-class activities, with huge financial input and time reservation.


When it turns to me, I have been active in the Club of Road Race for 2 years through which did I obtain physical fitness and mental happiness. To make things better, proposals are given for ascension. For students, interest is always reminder when facing difficult choices and balancing study and activity is of marvelous essential. For school, remember that only long-term support leads to outcome and it’s harmful to both sides did school quite half-way.


It’s sincere to say that After-school activities benefit a lot. Just join in and have fun!
