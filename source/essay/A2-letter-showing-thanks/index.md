Dear Alex:
	
How are things going? Knowing that you’re leaving for motherland, I’m writing to thank you for all you helped.

For years we have established firm friendship and you surely helped a lot. As things started to happen, you taught me language usages universally used in daily talking as well as formal documents, which made my English more “native”. Simultaneously, I learned how to construct essays form magazines you brought me. Further more, you led me a marvelous adventure through the culture boarding my horizon.
	
Without your help, I won’t achieve such rapid and solid ascent. May power give you strength at times of sorrow, may faith give you hope for every tomorrow.

Yours Sincere,
Li Hua.
