## Age of Enlightenment

### Spirits

The Age of Enlightenment (also known as the Age of Reason or simply the Enlightenment) was an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated the world of ideas in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries. The Enlightenment emerged out of a European intellectual and scholarly movement known as Renaissance humanism and was also preceded by the Scientific Revolution and the work of Francis Bacon, among others. Philosophers and scientists of the period widely circulated their ideas through meetings at scientific academies, Masonic lodges, literary salons, coffeehouses and in printed books, journals, and pamphlets. The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and the Catholic Church and paved the way for the political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. A variety of 19th-century movements, including liberalism and neoclassicism, trace their intellectual heritage to the Enlightenment.

Among the various achievements of the Enlightenment, one of the most important and valuable achievement is the proposal of the idea “liberty, equality, fraternity”. The philosophers believed that religion, tradition and superstition limited independent thought, and knowledge should be accepted based on observation, logic, and reason, not on faith. Based on these principles, these thinkers criticized the medieval belief in the divine right of Kings (the idea that God chose a country’s King, and that the king got his authority from God). In “The Social Contract”, Rousseau stated that all men are created free and equal. The government doesn’t have a high power over its people. Instead, the people give the political right to the government thus the government is the servant of its people. This became the root of the idea “liberty, equality, fraternity”, and today’s political ideology.

### The Enlightenment and the French Revolution

The age of the Enlightenment was like a fire taken from Prometheus, which threw a light on the people lived in the dark age of feudal dictatorship. It let the idea of democratic republic enter deeply into people’s heart and prepared the mind for the outbreak of the French Revolution. The Enlightenment resulted in “The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen”, which then became the theoretical basis of the French Revolution. Its spirit, principles and norms have been integrated into all aspects of social life, and in a sense, it can be said that “The Declaration of the Rights of Man” is a centralized representation of the human rights declarations of Western countries. That’s why the Enlightenment was the spark for the French Revolution and realization of human rights in the West.

## La Révolution française
### Duration

On July 14,1789,the capture of the Bastille became a signal of the French revolution. All cities followed the example of the people in Paris, armed themselves to seize the right of municipal administration, and established the National Guard.

Soon, the constituent assembly organized by the people took over the power. This year, the famous declaration of human rights was passed, which declared the principle of “personal freedom and equal rights” to the whole world.

On July 11, 1792, the legislative assembly declared that the motherland was in danger. The civilians of Paris set off the climax of the republican movement again.The Jacobin faction overthrowing the Bourbon Dynasty and overthrowing the rule of the constitutionalists.

On June 24, 1793 constitution was announced, which was the first democratic republican constitution in France, but it was not implemented due to the war.

On July 27, 1794, people who opposed dictatorship in the national assembly formed the Thermidor and launched the Thermidor reaction.The Thermidor established a new revolutionary government. They established the rule of the bourgeoisie, maintained the Republican government, and safeguarded the achievements of the bourgeois revolution in France.

The Thermidor reaction was generally regarded as the sign of the end of the great French revolution.

### Result

After the Thermidor reaction, in order to solve the domestic unrest, Napoleon launched another mutiny, began autocratic rule and became the emperor, known as the Coup of Brumaire in history. During the reign of Napoleon, his achievements not only lie in winning dozens of wars, but also in promulgating the Napoleonic Code. Napoleonic Code is also known as civil code. Napoleon attached great importance to it and participated in most of the seminars. After three and a half years of revision, Napoleonic Code was passed in 1804. The most important thing in the code is to confirm the principle of people’s property ownership and fully guarantee that the rights of individuals are not violated.

### Impact

#### The meaning of the French Revolution

The French Revolution was the largest and most radical revolution in modern world history, destroying the French monarchy, shaking the feudal order of the entire European continent, and spreading the ideas of liberty and equality throughout the world. The aristocratic and religious privileges of the past were constantly challenged by liberal political organizations and by people who took to the streets to protest. Old ideas were gradually replaced by new democratic ideas, and many movements that focused on human rights emerged in the world. The American Civil War was one of the most influential of these movements. It gave millions of African Americans political citizenship and the right to vote, which meant the end of slavery.

#### Rights of The Individual

One of the most important set of principles that emerged from the French Revolution were contained in the “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.”

This one document granted freedom of speech, press, ownership, and association of land. Socially discriminative system like the Estate system were dismantled. The nobility held no additional rights to the poorest farmer in France and the Church could no longer dictate the lives of its followers. These ideas spread throughout Europe during the Napoleonic wars.

Women did have some sway over the newly formed Republican government and lobbied for change through various clubs. Slavery was also abolished in France’s colonies. Both steps forward were later reversed by Napoleon, but seeds were sewn for the suffrage and antislavery movement in France.

#### Economic Equality

Before the French Revolution, most land was owned by the Church or Nobility. When they were removed from power, this land was redistributed to small landowners. Tithes and Taxes were reduced, and suddenly thousands of new landowners existed.

In the cities, business flourished as old restrictions from pre-revolutionary France were abolished.

### Summary

Many Revolutionary symbols such as La Marseillaise and phrases like “liberty, equality, fraternity”reappeared in other revolts, such as the 1917 Russian Revolution. Over the next two centuries, the key principles of the French Revolution like equality would inspire campaigns for the abolition of slavery and universal suffrage, such as the American War of Independence. Its values and institutions still have a tremendous influence on the current society, and many historians regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history.
