Dear Peter,
  How are things going? Knowing from your latest letter that you wonder how to ues the mobile payment for visiting China,I’m writing to deliver a brief introduction.

  As a common phenomenon, the mobile payment based on QR code tech has been used universally to make mayment easier and smarter. To involve yourself in, register your account on WeChat or Alipay with your TEL and add your credit card. Your eID or passport is also demanded to make yourself identified. Then scan with the app to pay your bill. Which is of vast importance is safety. Remember to set your password and don’t combine payment code with reward code.

  Wish you good time in China enjoying mobile payment. If you have more questions, don’t hesitate to let me know.

  Yours sincerely,
  LiHua.
