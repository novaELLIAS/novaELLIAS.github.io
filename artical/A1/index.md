Dear Tom,
    How are things going? Learning from your latest letter that you're in great passion for the Chinese culture after watching the National Treasure, I'm writing to deliver a brief introduction.

    Since the ancient time, the Chinese culture has been streaming through thousands of years' history. The reason why it lasts so long is that it changes itself to adapt to the current time. It's just time and people give birth to the culture and bring it up.

    Antique is witness of history. In my humble opinion, admiring the treasure is one of the best ways to lern about the culture. The Forbidden city witnessed the ancient ruyal life, while huTong witnessed life of common people. Antique is just lying there, telling its historical and mystorical story.

    It is spirit of the culture that makes the antique meaningful. The Terracotta Army shows the extreme and surpirme power of the empire and parks in JiangNan shows "He", eternal core of Chinese Archiculture.

    As a Chinese citizon, I'm more than happy to introduce Chinese culture to the world. If you want to learn furthur and deeper, don't hesitate to let me know.
